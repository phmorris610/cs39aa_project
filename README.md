# cs39aa_project_part1 Project Explanation
The data set I have chosen consists of movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. I gleaned the data from Kaggle then trimmed the 1 million plus observations to 10,000; there were some null observations which were also trimmed. The reviews are classified as either Rotten or Fresh, and the goal of this project will be to create a model to predict if the y observation is either Rotten or Fresh (represented in the Review_Type binary vector) with a reasonable degree of confidence. There is also a binary vector of observations denoting either a Top Critic or not a Top Critic, I will also be attempting to predict if the review was created by a Top Critic or not.
